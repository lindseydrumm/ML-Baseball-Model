# Baseball Machine Learning Model

This model uses pitching data from Kaggle from post-season pitchers in the MLB over the last 100+ years. It combines the pitching statistics for multiple pitchers as well as the outcomes of each post-season series, using this information to predict whichteam, based on the numbers, would win the series.
